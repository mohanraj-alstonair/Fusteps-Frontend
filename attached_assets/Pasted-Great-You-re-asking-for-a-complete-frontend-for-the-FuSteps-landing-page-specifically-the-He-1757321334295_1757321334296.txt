Generate:

* File structure with component-based layout
* Full JSX for each section
* Tailwind classes using FuSteps theme

Would you like me to turn this into the actual **JSX code** for each section with animations and layout next? I can generate that piece by piece — just say:

> “Generate Hero Section JSX”
> or
> “Give me all JSX files with Tailwind for homepage”

Let me know your preference.
