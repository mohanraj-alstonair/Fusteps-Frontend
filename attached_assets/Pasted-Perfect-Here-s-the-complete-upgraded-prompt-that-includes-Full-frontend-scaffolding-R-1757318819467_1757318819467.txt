Perfect. Here's the **complete, upgraded prompt** that includes:

* Full frontend scaffolding
* Role-based dashboards
* Student onboarding flow
* **AND** auto-generation of every **menu page** for each dashboard with routing + placeholders.

This is a **React + Tailwind** implementation-ready prompt. You can give this to ChatGPT (GPT-4 or GPT-4o), and it will start generating a modular frontend with routing, layouts, and UI components following your **FuSteps Design System**.

### ✅ **FINAL MASTER PROMPT: Full FuSteps Frontend with All Dashboard Pages**

````prompt
You are a frontend developer assistant. I want to generate a full React + TailwindCSS frontend app scaffold for a multi-role platform called **FuSteps**. Follow these specs:

---

## 🧱 SYSTEM GOALS

- Build full frontend architecture using:
  - React (with Hooks)
  - React Router for navigation
  - TailwindCSS (custom theme provided)
- Include:
  - Top bar with **Login** and **Register**
  - Auth pages (with role selection during register)
  - Redirect after login based on role
  - Role-based dashboard for:
    - Student
    - Mentor
    - Alumni
    - Employer
    - Admin
  - After Student registers, show a 3-step onboarding flow
  - Include sidebar with active link highlighting
  - **Generate all dashboard menu pages** (per role) as placeholders with titles + sections

---

## 🔑 AUTH FLOW

- `/login` and `/register` pages
- On register, show a dropdown to choose role:
  `Student`, `Mentor`, `Alumni`, `Employer`, `Admin`
- After login/register:
  - If role = `Student`, go to `/onboarding` (3 steps below)
  - If role ≠ Student, go directly to `/dashboard/{role}`

---

## 🧑‍🎓 STUDENT ONBOARDING FLOW

Multi-step form after registering as Student:

**Step 1:** Career preference → `Job`, `Internship`, `Skill Upgrade`, `Startup Idea` (radio buttons)  
**Step 2:** Education, skills, goals (text fields, multi-select)  
**Step 3:** Resume upload, profile completeness bar  
→ After this, go to `/dashboard/student`

---

## 🔀 ROUTES

```bash
/
├── /login
├── /register
├── /onboarding (only for students)
├── /dashboard/student
├── /dashboard/mentor
├── /dashboard/alumni
├── /dashboard/employer
├── /dashboard/admin
````

Use **React Router** with **nested routing** and role-based redirects. Setup `DashboardLayout.jsx` and use it across all dashboards.

---

## 📂 FOLDER STRUCTURE

* `pages/` → route components
* `pages/student/` → all Student menu pages
* `pages/mentor/` → Mentor pages
* `pages/employer/` → Employer pages
* `pages/alumni/` → Alumni pages
* `pages/admin/` → Admin pages
* `components/` → reusable components
* `layouts/` → shared layouts
* `hooks/` → auth/context helpers
* `theme/` → tailwind.config.js and design tokens

---

## 📚 MENU MAP PER DASHBOARD (GENERATE ALL PAGES BELOW)

For each dashboard, create all menu pages as components, add routing, and placeholder layout:

### ✅ Student Dashboard

* `Internships.jsx`
* `Courses.jsx`
* `Mentors.jsx`
* `Projects.jsx`
* `Library.jsx`
* `StudyAbroad.jsx`
* `JobTools.jsx`
* `Notifications.jsx`
* `Profile.jsx`

### ✅ Mentor Dashboard

* `Today.jsx`
* `Mentees.jsx`
* `Calendar.jsx`
* `Sessions.jsx`
* `Feedback.jsx`
* `Resources.jsx`
* `Earnings.jsx`
* `Settings.jsx`

### ✅ Alumni Dashboard

* `Overview.jsx`
* `Mentor.jsx`
* `PostOpportunity.jsx`
* `Events.jsx`
* `Community.jsx`
* `Impact.jsx`
* `Profile.jsx`

### ✅ Employer Dashboard

* `Postings.jsx`
* `Applicants.jsx`
* `Interviews.jsx`
* `Messages.jsx`
* `Analytics.jsx`
* `CompanyProfile.jsx`
* `Billing.jsx`

### ✅ Admin Dashboard

* `Users.jsx`
* `Approvals.jsx`
* `Analytics.jsx`
* `Reports.jsx`
* `Announcements.jsx`
* `AuditLogs.jsx`
* `Settings.jsx`

Each page should:

* Be inside its respective role folder (`pages/student/Internships.jsx`, etc.)
* Use `DashboardLayout`
* Include placeholder `<h1>` with page name
* Include sample section or card component
* Sidebar should highlight the active page

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM — FUSTEPS THEME

Apply this custom Tailwind theme:

```ts
// tailwind.config.ts
export default {
  darkMode: 'class',
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        ink:  { 900:'#040303',700:'#121110',500:'#2a2928',300:'#a8a29e' },
        sun:  { 100:'#FFFBE2',300:'#F9F0AD',500:'#F4EA91',700:'#D9CD62' },
        leaf: { 100:'#EEF6E6',300:'#D9EAC3',500:'#BFD494',700:'#99B36F' },
        slate:{ 100:'#EEF2F5',300:'#BFC9D1',500:'#778A9A',700:'#53606B' },
        ember:{ 100:'#FBE7E4',300:'#EEA59A',500:'#C94433',700:'#983326' },
        neutral:{ 25:'#F8F8F7',100:'#EDEDED',900:'#0B0B0C' }
      },
      borderRadius: { '2xl':'1rem' },
      boxShadow: {
        card:'0 6px 24px rgba(0,0,0,.06)',
        modal:'0 12px 40px rgba(0,0,0,.16)'
      },
      fontFamily: { display:['Poppins','Inter','ui-sans-serif'], body:['Inter','system-ui'] }
    }
  }
}
```

**UI Guidelines:**

* Primary button: `bg-ink-900`, `text-white`, hover opacity, focus ring `sun-500`
* Secondary: `bg-sun-100`, `text-ink-900`, hover `sun-300`
* Cards: `bg-white`, `rounded-2xl`, shadow `card`, borders `neutral-100`
* Inputs: border `slate-300`, focus ring `sun-500`, error = `ember-500`
* Motion: 180–220ms transitions, ease-out on entry, ease-in on exit

---

## 📦 OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS

✅ Output:

* File/folder structure
* Login/Register/Auth flow
* Student onboarding pages
* Routing setup
* Sidebar layout for each role
* All menu pages with placeholder UI
* Tailwind styles applied using FuSteps theme

Use clean JSX, Tailwind utility classes, modular components, and route wrappers. Don't write backend logic—use mock login state.

```

### 🧠 How to use this prompt:
Paste it directly into ChatGPT (GPT-4 / GPT-4o), and then follow up with:

> "Generate the folder structure and `App.jsx` + `Router.jsx` setup first."

Then ask it to generate code **section by section** (e.g., Login page, then Student Dashboard pages, etc.).

---

Let me know if you'd like a **follow-up prompt** for:

- Connecting this to a backend API (Node/Express or Firebase)  
- Generating mock JSON data for each role  
- Adding role-based protected routes  
- Exporting everything as a Vite/Next.js project structure

I can generate that next.
```
